1) Explain REST

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.
It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource.
The representation of the state can be in a JSON format, and probably for most APIs this is indeed the case. It can also be in XML or HTML format.

2) Explain the architectural style for the creation of a web API (client server communication, formatting language, number of servers, etc.)
i
   HTTP for client server communication
   XML/JSON as formatting language
   Simple URI as the address for the services
   Stateless communication

3) What are the best practices when deploying an application in the cloud

   Creating Agile Environments with DevOps
   Creating a Defined Deployment Process
   Adoption of Cloud Automation Processes and Tools
   Security Built-Ins During Deployment
   Applying Kaizen with SDI

4) What are your best strength : infra ? DB ? web ?
Give us detail about it 

My field of expertise is web developpement, since most of my professial projects are deeply rooted into 
every aspect of this domain meaning fullstack(frontend / backend). This deep knowlegde of the world of
web developpement allows me to overcome serverel erros, achieve test fucntionalities and even cover the 
design aspect of this field(web design)

5) Among all the projects you have worked on. Which architecture do you enjoy the most? explain why ?

the architecture that i am most found of is the client server architecture as i find it flexible meaning
that it can be easily implemented, replaced, repaired , upgraded and relocated on a server
without harming the client. the other reason that made me leaning toward this architecture is that it's easy
to make a back up of it since it is stored on a server and it keeps on running smoothly despite of heavy use.
